  The study of genetic variation among human individuals
  engenders substantial archives of details on individual genomes.
  Details of genetic variation are interpreted using evolving
  resources assembled at various scales.  NCBI's dbSNP assembles
  information on relatively small variants that occur with
  some regularity in human populations.  The EMBL-EBI GWAS catalog
  provides a curated view of replicated studies of genotype-phenotype
  association.  This workflow reviews the use of Bioconductor packages
  that help investigators interpret their own findings in studies
  of human genetics.

# Background

The table of contents of Vogel and Motulsky's [_Human Genetics: Problems and Approaches_](https://books.google.com/books?id=xuztCAAAQBAJ&lpg=PA6&dq=human%20genetics&pg=PR32#v=onepage&q=human%20genetics&f=false)
is a worthy survey of concepts addressed in research on human
genetics and genetic medicine.  The frontiers of knowledge in the field
are shifting, and expectations are high.

In this workflow, I aim to show how researchers can use R
to interrogate important resources of use in human genetic
epidemiology and medical genomics.  We'll begin with a
brief treatment of "reference genome builds" for _Homo sapiens_,
coupled with tools for obtaining and programming with gene models.
We'll then look at approaches for working with
the [NCBI dbSNP](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/)
catalog of small variants.
This is followed by a view of the [EMBL-EBI GWAS](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/) (genome-wide association
study) catalog.  We conclude with an illustration of
integrating population-level finding on DNA sequence variants with
recent research results on epigenetic variation.

# Reference builds of the human genome sequence

The most recent build of the human genomic sequence
is labeled GRCh38.  Using Bioconductor, we can be very concrete about what this
is.

```{r lkhg}
library(BSgenome.Hsapiens.NCBI.GRCh38)
class(Hsapiens)
Hsapiens
class(Hsapiens$"1")
Hsapiens$"1"
```
